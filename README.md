# Python-Project-1

## Delegation
1. Work with `shapely` -- finding zipcodes for traffic crashes - Alice
2. Map potholes by zipcode - Victor and Fjolle
3. Looking for crime data - Steven
4. Summary statistics - Abby and Christina
5. Traffic data and pothole data are too big and import data - Brendan

## Comments/Ideas
1. Use `geopy` to match street names from traffic dataset to zip codes
2. Ideas for actual dataset:
  1. Completion duration
  2. Which months/times of year have more potholes?
3. Ideas for working with other datasets
  1. Income areas with most potholes
  2. Income areas that get their potholes fixed the fastest
5. Get city of chicago zipcodes shapefile cityofchicago.org boundaries - zipcodes
  1. Download **shapefile**
  2. plotting shapefiles: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/131716/plot-shapefile-with-matplotlib
